0x04. UTF-8 Validation
Tests knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills in validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

KEY CONCEPTS:
1. Bitwise Operation:
	Def: A mathematical operation performed on individual bits within a binary number.

	AND(&) : Returns 1 if both numbers are 1 else 0
	OR (|) : Returns 1 if one number is 1 else 0
	XOR (^) : Returns 1 is numbers are different else 0
	NOT (~) : Inverts the bits
	Shifts (<<, >>) : Moves bits to the left or right by specified postiions
	
	Realworld Application: low-level data manipulation, UTF-8 encoding, encyription algorithms, data compression & low-level programming s.a device drivers & network protocols

2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
	Def: a variable-length character encoding that uses one to four bytes to represent a character

	Key terms : Character Encoding, Unicode, Code-Point, Byte Order Mark(BOM)
